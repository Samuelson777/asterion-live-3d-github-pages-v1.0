## Run locally

Do not open `index.html` directly because browsers restrict local module and model loading.

```bash
python tools/serve.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Validate

```bash
python tools/validate_site.py
```

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload every file in this folder to the repository root.
3. Push to the `main` branch.
4. Open **Settings → Pages**.
5. Select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
6. The included `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow deploys the site.

The application is static and needs no server-side database. Three.js is pinned to version `0.185.1` through an import map.

## Claim boundary

This site presents conceptual engineering geometry and reduced-order screening. It does not claim a certified spacecraft, production aircraft, solved proprietary ANSYS database or fully parametric native Siemens NX release.

**Author:** Samuelson G
**Project version:** 1.0
**Project domain:** Aerospace engineering, aeronautics, spacecraft systems, CAD, CAM, CAE, simulation, optimisation, digital manufacturing, and interactive 3D visualisation

---

## Overview

**ASTERION FCTA-1** is an open-source multidisciplinary aerospace engineering project developed to demonstrate a complete spacecraft design workflow using **Siemens NX**, **ANSYS**, **NX CAM**, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and browser-based 3D technologies.

The project explores a modular, orbit-assembled, multi-regime spacecraft intended for long-duration operations beyond low Earth orbit. It combines:

* A central non-rotating structural spine
* Twin counter-rotating habitation rings
* Modular electric-propulsion pods
* Large deployable solar-power wings
* Deployable thermal-control radiators
* Radiation-protection and storm-shelter systems
* Docking, logistics, robotics, and maintenance systems
* A detachable lifting-body aeroshuttle named **Skimmer**
* Parametric CAD, structural analysis, thermal analysis, CFD, CAM, optimisation, and manufacturing documentation

ASTERION is presented as a **conceptual CAD/CAM/CAE demonstrator and engineering portfolio**, not as a flight-qualified spacecraft or a proven reactionless-propulsion system.

---

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of ASTERION FCTA-1 are to:

1. Demonstrate advanced Siemens NX modelling and assembly skills.
2. Demonstrate ANSYS structural, thermal, modal, buckling, and CFD workflows.
3. Demonstrate NX CAM process planning and manufacturing preparation.
4. Integrate spacecraft systems engineering with aeronautical vehicle design.
5. Build a reproducible engineering project that can be developed on a home PC.
6. Publish neutral CAD geometry, technical documentation, scripts, drawings, and results openly.
7. Present the complete project through an interactive GitHub Pages 3D application.
8. Clearly separate verified artefacts, reduced-order screening results, conceptual assumptions, and native-software work still requiring execution.

---

## Engineering Concept

ASTERION is based on the idea that a deep-space vehicle should not be treated as a single-use rocket.

Instead, the spacecraft is divided into serviceable modules that can be launched separately, assembled in orbit, upgraded, repaired, and reconfigured for different missions.

| Habitation sectors             |                              24 |
| Reference crew                 |                               4 |

### Ring Dynamics

At a 12 m occupied radius and approximately 4.3 rpm:

* Artificial gravity is approximately **0.248 g**
* Balanced counter-rotating emergency braking produced approximately **1.846 mm** screening translation
* A single-ring braking fault produced approximately **3.487 mm** screening translation

### Thermal Screening

| Study                               |        Screening result |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| Effective radiator emitting area    |                  144 m² |
| Nominal 120 kW radiator equilibrium |   Approximately 361.4 K |
| Five-panel degraded equilibrium     |   Approximately 377.9 K |
| Electronics cold-plate hotspot      |   Approximately 324.6 K |
| Habitat-wall heat leak              | Approximately 1.30 W/m² |
| Thruster-bracket peak temperature   |   Approximately 334.4 K |

### Cabin Ventilation Screening

| Condition |  Airflow |                  Predicted well-mixed CO₂ |

| Degraded  |  80 m³/h |                     Approximately 920 ppm |
| Fan loss  |   0 m³/h | 1000 ppm after approximately 27.9 minutes |

### Skimmer Aerodynamic Screening

At approximately 5° angle of attack:

| Case     | Screening lift-to-drag ratio |
| -------- | ---------------------------: |
| Mach 0.3 |            Approximately 7.9 |
| Mach 0.8 |            Approximately 4.5 |
| Mach 2.0 |            Approximately 2.2 |

## Running the Live 3D Website

Do not open `index.html` directly from Windows Explorer because browser security restrictions may block JavaScript modules and GLB loading.

### Windows

```bat
START_ASTERION.bat
```

### Python Local Server

```bash
python tools/serve.py
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Upload the website files to the repository root.
3. Push the files to the `main` branch.
4. Open **Settings → Pages**.
5. Select **GitHub Actions** as the deployment source.
6. Run the included Pages workflow.
7. Open the generated GitHub Pages URL.

---

## Siemens NX Workflow

The native Siemens NX files should be reconstructed using the included:

* Master-model expressions
* Station tables
* Coordinate-system definitions
* Component manifests
* WAVE-link maps
* NXOpen journals
* Neutral geometry
* Tutorial drawings
* Assembly and drawing checklists

Typical native file naming:

```text
AST-0000-ASTERION-FCTA-1-ASSY.prt
AST-0000-ASTERION-FCTA-1-ASSY-DRW.prt
AST-1100-CENTRAL-SPINE.prt
AST-3200-HABITATION-RING-ASSY.prt
AST-4300-SKIMMER-ASSY.prt

Siemens NX stores parts, assemblies, and drawing parts using the `.prt` extension.

---

## ANSYS Workflow

The project includes preparation data for:

* Static docking loads
* Propulsion thrust loads

## Claims and Limitations

ASTERION FCTA-1 is:

* A conceptual spacecraft architecture
* A CAD/CAM/CAE portfolio project
* An educational engineering demonstrator
* An open-source technical communication project
* A basis for future native CAD and simulation work

ASTERION FCTA-1 is not:

* A flight-qualified spacecraft
* A certified pressure vessel
* A validated human-rated vehicle
* A proven reactionless-propulsion system
* A faster-than-light spacecraft
* A replacement for professional aerospace certification
* A source of machine-ready production G-code
* A completed native Siemens NX or solved ANSYS project unless those files are executed and added separately

---

## Conclusion

ASTERION FCTA-1 demonstrates a complete multidisciplinary aerospace-development workflow covering spacecraft systems engineering, aeronautical design, CAD, CAE, CAM, optimisation, manufacturing planning, validation, documentation, and interactive 3D presentation.

The project successfully transforms an unconventional deep-space transportation concept into a structured and technically reviewable engineering portfolio. Instead of making unsupported claims about unrestricted travel, the design uses a modular orbit-assembled architecture with electric propulsion, replaceable subsystems, counter-rotating habitation rings, large power systems, thermal-control radiators, radiation protection, robotics, docking systems, and a detachable lifting-body aeroshuttle.

The development process produced measurable engineering improvements. Structural redesign substantially reduced propulsion and docking deformation while increasing the first supported natural frequency. Thermal and ventilation studies identified radiator performance, degraded cooling behaviour, cabin heat-removal needs, and ventilation redundancy requirements. Aerodynamic studies established a preliminary Skimmer performance baseline, while the CAM package demonstrated representative machining, inspection, workholding, and additive-manufacturing workflows.

The final public release integrates neutral geometry, scripts, engineering drawings, analyses, documentation, manufacturing plans, validation records, and a live GitHub Pages 3D application. It therefore serves as a strong portfolio for Siemens NX, ANSYS, aerospace systems engineering, digital manufacturing, software development, and open-source technical communication.

The project remains conceptual. Its strongest value is not a claim that the spacecraft is ready to fly, but the transparent integration of requirements, assumptions, calculations, CAD, simulation, optimisation, manufacturing preparation, and reproducible documentation into one coherent engineering project.
